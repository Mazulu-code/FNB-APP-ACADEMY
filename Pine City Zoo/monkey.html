                <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                <P>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes.</P>
                <p> Thus monkeys, in that sense, constitute an incomplete paraphyletic grouping; alternatively, if apes (Hominoidea) are included, monkeys and simians are synonyms.</p>
                <P><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></P>
                <P>You will find the Monkeys next to the Coffee shop</P>
